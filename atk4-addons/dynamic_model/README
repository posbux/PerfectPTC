This addon has some automatic capabilities of creating either
tables on the fly or model on the fly.

WARNING: Do not use on production environment, this add-on
will fetch table description every time model is initialized

== Model -> SQL ==========================================


inside your model's init:

  $this->addField('name');
  $this->addField('surname');

 $this->add('dynamic_model/Controller_AutoCreator');
 // Will ensure that table contains all necessary fields
 

== SQL -> Model ==========================================

inside your model's init:

 $this->add('dynamic_model/Controller_PopulateFields');
 // Will read database and create your model field as necessary


========================================================
 Notes: Currently only Model->SQL is supported and there are
no support for foreign keys.  Also only SQLITE is tested,
but should also work with MySQL. Patches are welcome.
